TO DO: (order sort-of matters for coupled items)
: IMPLEMENT HELP BUTTON

: IMPLEMENT TEST BUTTON

: EDIT TAB BINDING TO SELECT THE WHOLE FIELD

: PRESS ESCAPE IN EDIT MODE TO CANCEL EDIT

: ALL INSTANCES OF SELECTION CHANGES ARE REMOVED VIA '#.'
	- USE AND DETERMINE WHEN AND HOW RESELECTS SHOULD BE APPLIED
		decided instances include:
		- item0 select after first populate

: FIX DUPLICATION ISSUES

: ADD A TEMPLATE COUNT - MAYBE RIGHT ABOVE THE SCROLLBAR?

: IN LISTBOX, PRESSING A LETTER SCROLL TO THE FIRST ENTRY STARTING WITH THAT LETTER?
	- might require a build of a lookup dict on namelist update
	
: UPPERCASE SORT ORDER FOR TEMPLATENAMEBOX
	sorted(/list/, key=str.lower)
	
: RETOOL INTERFACE
	- INCREASE CONTRAST ON LOCKED ITEMS
	- LEARN STYLING
	- MINIMIZE USE OF NON-LABEL FRAMES, EVERYTHING SHOULD JUST BE IN THE ROOT WINDOW
	- CHANGE TEXT FIELDS TO ENTRY FIELDS
	- REMOVE SOME OF THE DIALOGS ON SAVE
	- PROGRESS BAR ON SAVE
	- WIDER TEXT FIELDS
	- COLUMN STICKYNESS FOR STRECHING
	- APPLY ELEMENT PADDING
	- ADD MENUBAR, ALLOW FOR ABOUT/HELP STUFF?
		- look into using the page tk builder thing
	- PERHAPS USE A PANED WINDOW
	- ADD ITEM PATH FIELD

: XML
	- SPLIT COMMENT INTO OWN SUB-ITEM, VALUE AS NON-ATTRIBUTE BUT TAGGEDTEXT
	- SPLIT PATH INTO OWN SUB-ITEM, VALUE AS NON-ATTRIBUTE BUT TAGGEDTEXT

: IMPLEMENT LAST-ACTION FLAG
	- to check if has been saved since last edit, or if any edits have been made at all
	- cancel edit needs to avoid setting an edit flag
	- don't check flag's current state before setting
: SAVE-BUTTON ENABLE/DISABLE
: ON-EXIT SAVE

MAYBE JUST RECODE THE WHOLE DAMNTHING - LEAVING BASIC READ-IN AND WRITE-OUT STRUCTURES
SET THE EDIT, DELETE, DUPLICATE BUTTONS TO ONLY UNLOCK IF SOMETHING IS SELECTED
	-RUN UPDATE FIELDS AFTER SELECTION?
ENTER EDIT MODE AFTER YOU CLICK DUPLICATE?

ADD A SECOND LEVEL OF TRY AROUND FileNameError try groups for NameError - python2 is name error.
	maybe set the namelist removal as its own fn?

FIND A BETTER WAY TO GET THE NAME OF THE SELECTION
	current is on line 99 - seems clunky
	can we get a better index retrieval method? maybe?

INVESTIGATE:
: REPLACE XML WITH PICKLE?
: COMPRESS THE OLD FOLDER?
: SET EVENT BINDINGS TO LAMBDA FN - WILL OMITTING THE #ARGS AS A RESULT BE A SAVINGS?
: REMOVE CANCEL BUTTON AND HAVE IT ONLY SHOW UP IN EDITMODE?
	bind to main window
	if interactionmode!=normal: cancel()
	else: return 'break'

FUTURE:
GENERALISE THE APPLICATION AWAY FROM JUST GEOMETRY
	ADD PAGE ASSIGNMENT FUNCTIONALITY
	MEANS UPDATING THE INTERFACE TO INCLUDE GEOM AND ASSIGN TICKBOXES.
		ERROR IF NEITHER IS SELECTED
	GIT BRANCH
		learn git
