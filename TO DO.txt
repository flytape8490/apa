to do:
SET THE EDIT, DELETE, DUPLICATE BUTTONS TO ONLY UNLOCK IF SOMETHING IS SELECTED
REMOVE ALL INSTANCES OF SOFTWARE-DRIVEN ITEM SELECTION, RUN THROUGH THE SOFTWARE AND FIGURE OUT WHERE THEY SHOULD HAPPEN
	-APPLY LOGICALLY, (ALONG WITH SCROLL TO VIEW?)
	-DO THIS FOR DELETE - EITHER SELECT ITEM 0 OR SELECT THE ITEM NEAREST THE DELETED ITEM
	-RUN UPDATE FIELDS AFTER SELECTION?
FIX DUPLICATION ISSUES
TEMPLATEBOXREFRESH: CHECK UPPERCASE FOR SORT ORDER
ENTER EDIT MODE AFTER YOU CLICK DUPLICATE?
IMPLEMENT HELP BUTTON
IMPLEMENT TEST BUTTON
MODIFY TAB EVENT TO SELECT ALL THE TEXT IN THE BOX TABBED INTO
SET UP ENTER EVENT FOR EACH ENTRY BOX- SHOULD BE 'APPLY'	<Return> not <Enter>
TEMPLATEBOXREFRESH: SET SCROLL TO NEWLY ENTERED/EDITED ITEM
ADD A SECOND LEVEL OF TRY AROUND FileNameError try groups for NameError - python2 is name error.
ADD A TEMPLATE COUNT - MAYBE RIGHT ABOVE THE SCROLLBAR?
	maybe set the namelist removal as its own fn?

PROGRESS BAR ON SAVING
RESTYLE THE INTERFACE: MAKE NOT-UGLY ON MAC - INCREASE CONTRAST FOR LOCKED FIELDS
CONSIDER ZIPPING THE OLD FOLDER? IT WOULD COMPRESS REALLY WELL
MINIMIZE THE AMOUNT OF DIALOGUES ON SAVING?
HAVE AN ON-EXIT SAVE?

FIGURE-OUT CONDITIONAL SAVE-BUTTON ACTIVATION
INVESTIGATE PANED WINDOW (FRAME?) FOR THE INTERFACE
SET EVENT BINDINGS TO LAMBDA FN - WILL OMITTING THE #ARGS AS A RESULT BE A SAVINGS?
WRAPPING IS OFF, BUT STILL WANT WIDER TEXT FIELDS
SET STICKYNESS FOR BOX SCALING

FUTURE:
GENERALISE THE APPLICATION AWAY FROM JUST GEOMETRY
	ADD ASSIGNMENT FUNCTIONALITY
	MEANS UPDATING THE INTERFACE TO INCLUDE GEOM AND ASSIGN TICKBOXES.
		ERROR IF NEITHER IS SELECTED
rename things for consistency
restructure
comment
fix/investigate other #!!
add test
add help
cosmetic (padding, framing, why is it ugly on mac?)
